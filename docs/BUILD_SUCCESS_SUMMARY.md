## Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. GraphQL Type Mismatch Resolution
**Problem:** Interface field `WpNodeWithFeaturedImage.featuredImage` expected type `WpNodeWithFeaturedImageToMediaItemConnectionEdgeType` but custom post types returned `WpMediaItem`.

**Solution:** Removed conflicting custom type definitions from `gatsby-node.js` that were overriding the auto-generated WordPress GraphQL schema.

### 2. Missing Field Handling
**Problems:** 
- `excerpt` field missing on custom post types (`WpBeat`, `WpTutorial`, `WpMix`)
- ACF fields (`beatsFields`, `tutorialFields`, `mixFields`) not available yet

**Solutions:**
- Commented out `excerpt` field queries in all listing pages
- Commented out ACF field queries until field groups are imported
- Updated TypeScript interfaces to make these fields optional
- Added conditional rendering to handle missing data gracefully

### 3. File Parsing Issues
**Problem:** Syntax errors in `src/pages/{Page.slug}.js`

**Solution:** Fixed malformed imports and incomplete GraphQL queries.
