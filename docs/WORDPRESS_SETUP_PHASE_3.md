âœ… **Blog integration functional**  
âœ… **Build system stable**  
ðŸ”„ **Ready for WordPress content integration**

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step WordPress Setup

### Step 1: Start Local WordPress Environment

#### Option A: Using Local by Flywheel (Recommended)
1. **Open Local by Flywheel application**
2. **Start the "w-jeldonmusic" site** (if it exists)
3. **Verify it's running on localhost:10008**

#### Option B: Alternative Local Setup
If Local by Flywheel isn't available:
```bash
# Using Docker Compose (create if needed)
docker-compose up -d wordpress
```

#### Option C: Update Environment Variables
If WordPress is running on a different port:
```bash
# Edit .env.development
# Change WPGRAPHQL_URL to match your WordPress GraphQL endpoint
WPGRAPHQL_URL='http://localhost:[YOUR_PORT]/graphql'
```

### Step 2: Verify WordPress Connection

```bash
cd /Volumes/PRO-BLADE/Github/jeldonmusic_com/site1
node ./scripts/test-wp-connection.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
âœ… WordPress GraphQL connection successful
âœ… WP GraphQL plugin detected
âœ… ACF to WPGraphQL plugin detected
```

### Step 3: Import ACF Field Groups

```bash
# Run the automated import script
yarn wp:import-acf
```

**Manual Alternative** (if script fails):
1. Open WordPress Admin: `http://localhost:10008/wp-admin`
2. Go to Custom Fields â†’ Tools â†’ Import Field Groups
3. Import files from `./scripts/` directory:
   - `acf-beats-fields.json`
   - `acf-tutorial-fields.json`
   - `acf-mix-fields.json`

### Step 4: Create Sample Content

#### Blog Posts (Test Mobile Image Fix)
1. **Create 3-5 blog posts** with featured images
2. **Add various image sizes** to test responsiveness
3. **Test on mobile device** or browser dev tools

#### Custom Post Types
1. **Create 2-3 Beats** with:
   - Featured images
   - BPM, key, genre
   - Audio file links
   - Pricing information

2. **Create 2-3 Tutorials** with:
   - Featured images/thumbnails
   - Video URLs (YouTube embeds)
   - Difficulty levels
   - Equipment lists

3. **Create 1-2 Mixes** with:
   - Featured images
   - Tracklists
   - Audio files
   - Genre classifications
