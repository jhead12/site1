   - Clarified directory creation process

   - Enhanced script to use absolute paths
   - Added creation of placeholder files for required directories

## Next Steps

The site should now build on Netlify without requiring a WordPress connection. For local development, you can use:
- Regular development: `yarn develop`
- WordPress-free development: `yarn develop:mock`

Once WordPress is stable and accessible from Netlify, you can revert to using the standard build command by updating netlify.toml.

## Testing the Fix

To test the latest schema fixes:

1. Clean the cache first to ensure a fresh build:
   ```bash
   gatsby clean
   ```

2. Run a local build with WordPress bypass:
   ```bash
   GATSBY_CONFIG_FILE=gatsby-config-ssl-bypass.js BYPASS_WORDPRESS=true gatsby develop
   ```

3. Test the Netlify build command:
   ```bash
   yarn build:netlify
   ```

The site should now build successfully with demo content in place of WordPress data.
