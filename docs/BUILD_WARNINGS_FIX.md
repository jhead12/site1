# Build Warnings and Issues Fix

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve build warnings and issues in the Gatsby project.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing CSS Exports in UI Components

Several warnings were related to missing CSS classes that were being imported from ui.css:
- `icons`
- `iconLink`
- `interactiveIcon`
- `visuallyHidden`
- `blockLink`

**Fix:** Added the missing CSS classes to ui.css with appropriate styling.

### 2. Unused GraphQL Imports

Several components had unused graphql imports that were triggering ESLint warnings:
- benefit-list.js
- product-list.js
- stat-list.js
- testimonial-list.js

**Fix:** 
- Removed unused graphql imports from components that don't define GraphQL fragments
- Added clarifying comments to imports in components that do use GraphQL for fragment definition

### 3. WordPress Media File Size Limit

Warning about media files exceeding the configured size limit:

```
There were 1 files with file sizes that are above the maxFileSizeBytes config option and consequently were not fetched.
```

**Fix:** Increased the `maxFileSizeBytes` setting in gatsby-config.js from 15MB to 30MB to accommodate larger media files.

## Implementation Details

1. Created CSS classes for the missing UI components:
   - Added proper styling for visual elements like icons, hidden elements, and special links

2. Created and ran a script (`scripts/fix-unused-imports.sh`) to automatically detect and remove unused GraphQL imports

3. Modified the WordPress media configuration in gatsby-config.js to allow larger file downloads

## Benefits

1. Reduced warning messages during build process
2. Improved code quality by removing unused imports
3. Enabled larger media files to be processed correctly
4. Enhanced developer experience with cleaner build output

## Next Steps

1. Monitor build logs for any remaining warnings
2. Consider adding these CSS classes to a style guide
3. Implement stricter ESLint rules to catch unused imports earlier
