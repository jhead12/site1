yarn clean:wp
yarn clean
yarn develop:wp
```

## **Next Steps for Phase 1 Implementation:**

Now that the build is working, you can proceed with the WordPress setup phase:

1. **Set up environment variables** in `.env.development`:
   ```bash
   WPGRAPHQL_URL="https://your-wordpress-site.com/graphql"
   WP_USERNAME="your_wp_username"
   WP_PASSWORD="your_wp_password"
   ```

2. **Install WordPress plugins** as outlined in the setup guide:
   - WP GraphQL
   - Advanced Custom Fields Pro
   - WP GraphQL for ACF

3. **Test the WordPress connection**:
   ```bash
   yarn wp:test-connection
   ```

4. **Start development with WordPress**:
   ```bash
   yarn develop:wp
   ```
Once Phase 1 is complete, you'll be ready for **Phase 2: Content Management Enhancement** where we'll:
- Set up ACF field groups
- Create WordPress admin customizations
- Build content workflows
