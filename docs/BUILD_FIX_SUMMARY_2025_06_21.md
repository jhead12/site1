# Build Fix Summary - June 21, 2025

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Duplicate GraphQL Resolver**: Fixed duplicate `exports.createResolvers` function in `gatsby-node.js` that was causing conflicts and broken publicURL field
2. **WordPress Connection Timeout**: Added bypass mechanism for WordPress GraphQL in Netlify builds
3. **Missing `url` field**: Added `url` field as an alias of `publicURL` for File nodes to maintain API consistency
4. **Netlify Build Configuration**: Updated netlify.toml to use WordPress-bypassed build command
5. **Missing Audio Directory**: Enhanced directory creation script to handle all required directories and placeholder files
6. **WordPress Schema Errors**: Fixed GraphQL schema errors when WordPress is bypassed by providing a fallback WpMediaItem type and updating field references

## Changes Made

1. In `gatsby-node.js`:
   - Fixed duplicate resolver for File type
   - Added proper null check for relativePath
   - Added url field alias
   - Added fallback WpMediaItem type definition
   - Changed audioFile field references to use generic File type

2. In `package.json`:
   - Added dedicated `build:netlify` script for Netlify deployment
   - Integrated ensure-dirs script into build process

3. In `netlify.toml`:
   - Updated build command comments
   - Clarified directory creation process

4. In `scripts/ensure-directories.js`:
   - Enhanced script to use absolute paths
   - Added creation of placeholder files for required directories
   - Added demo track placeholders for audio player testing
   - Improved error handling and logging

5. In `src/components/player/persistent-player.js`:
   - Added support for handling placeholder audio files
   - Implemented graceful fallback for demo tracks
   - Added simulation of playback for placeholder files
   - Updated build command to use `yarn build:netlify`

4. Added documentation:
   - Created BUILD_FIX_GUIDE.md with detailed explanation

## Next Steps

The site should now build on Netlify without requiring a WordPress connection. For local development, you can use:
- Regular development: `yarn develop`
- WordPress-free development: `yarn develop:mock`

Once WordPress is stable and accessible from Netlify, you can revert to using the standard build command by updating netlify.toml.
