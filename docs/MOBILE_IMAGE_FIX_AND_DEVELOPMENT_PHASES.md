# Mobile Image Loading Fix & Development Phases Summary

**Date:** June 20, 2025  
**Status:** 🔧 Hero Banner Updated + React Hook Warnings Fixed

## 🐛 Mobile Image Loading Issue - RESOLVED

### Problem Identified
Blog post images were not displaying properly on mobile devices unless the page was refreshed. This was caused by:
1. **Lack of proper lazy loading implementation**
2. **Missing mobile-specific CSS optimizations** 
3. **No loading state management for images**
4. **Potential layout shift during image loading**

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Created Mobile-Specific CSS (`blog-mobile-fix.css`)
- **Responsive image containers** with proper aspect ratios
- **Loading states** with smooth transitions
- **Mobile-optimized dimensions** (120px height on mobile vs 150px on desktop)
- **Anti-layout-shift** techniques using wrapper containers
- **Loading animation** for better UX during image fetch

#### 2. Updated Image Components
- **blog-feature.js**: Added lazy loading and error handling
- **related-posts.js**: Implemented mobile-friendly image loading
- **blog.js**: Enhanced main blog page image rendering
- **blog-post.js**: Improved featured image loading in individual posts

#### 3. Enhanced Loading Behavior
```javascript
// Added to all image components:
loading="lazy"                    // Native browser lazy loading
onLoad={(e) => e.target.style.opacity = '1'}  // Smooth fade-in
onError={(e) => e.target.style.display = 'none'}  // Graceful error handling
style={{ opacity: 0, transition: "opacity 0.3s ease" }}  // Initial hidden state
```

#### 4. Mobile-First CSS Improvements
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .blog-feature-image {
    height: 120px; /* Optimized for mobile */
    border-radius: 8px;
  }
  
  .blog-feature-container {
    min-height: 120px; /* Prevent layout shift */
    background-color: #f5f5f5; /* Loading placeholder */
  }
}
```

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Test on actual mobile devices** (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
2. **Verify in mobile simulator** with throttled network
3. **Check loading performance** on slow connections
4. **Validate no layout shifts** during image loading

## 💡 Hero Banner Component Improvements (June 20, 2025)

### Issues Fixed in Rotating Hero Banner
1. **React Hook dependency warnings resolved**
   - Added `useCallback` hooks to properly memoize functions
   - Fixed "used before defined" errors for navigation functions
   - Added proper dependency arrays to all useEffect hooks

2. **GraphQL Query Optimizations**
   - Updated how `gatsbyImageData` is queried for Contentful images
   - Removed unsupported parameters (`layout`, `width`, `placeholder`, `formats`)
   - Aligned queries with proper schema support

3. **Code Structure Improvements**
   - Reorganized component structure for better readability
   - Moved function definitions before their usage
   - Enhanced state management for rotation and transitions
   - Optimized render cycles

### Benefits
- **Clean Build**: No warnings or errors during build process
