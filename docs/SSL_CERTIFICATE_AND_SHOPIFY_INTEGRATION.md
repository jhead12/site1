# SSL Certificate Fix & Shopify Integration Guide

## Current Issue: WordPress SSL Certificate Expired

The build is failing because the WordPress SSL certificate for `https://blog.jeldonmusic.com` has expired:

```
error gatsby-source-wordpress Error: certificate has expired
GraphQL request to https://blog.jeldonmusic.com/graphql failed.
```

## SSL Certificate Solutions

### Option 1: Temporary SSL Bypass (Development Only)
Add SSL bypass to gatsby-config.js for development builds:

```javascript
{
  resolve: "gatsby-source-wordpress",
  options: {
    url: process.env.WPGRAPHQL_URL,
    // Temporary SSL bypass for expired certificate
    httpHeaders: {
      'User-Agent': 'Gatsby',
    },
    // Add this for development with expired SSL
    ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && {
      options: {
        rejectUnauthorized: false
      }
    }),
    verbose: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
    // ... rest of config
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Use Alternative WordPress URL
Switch to HTTP temporarily or use a different domain:

```bash
# In .env files, change:
# WPGRAPHQL_URL=https://blog.jeldonmusic.com/graphql
# To:
WPGRAPHQL_URL=http://blog.jeldonmusic.com/graphql
```

### Option 3: Renew SSL Certificate (Recommended)
Contact your hosting provider to renew the SSL certificate for `blog.jeldonmusic.com`.
