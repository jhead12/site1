# WordPress Schema Fix Summary - June 21, 2025

## Issue Overview

Today we fixed numerous GraphQL schema errors that were occurring during Netlify builds with `BYPASS_WORDPRESS=true`. The errors mainly related to:

1. Missing or incomplete WordPress schema type definitions
2. Lack of support for query arguments like `formatString` on Date fields
3. Missing field definitions in filter input types
4. Absence of proper resolvers for complex structures like featured images and categories
5. Missing extensions on the Query type for WordPress root fields

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a comprehensive solution with the following components:

### 1. Enhanced Schema Type Definitions

- Created complete WordPress type definitions for all content types:
  - WpPost, WpPage, WpVideo, WpBeat, WpMix, WpTutorial
  - Connection types for categories, tags, authors, and media
  - Input types for filters and sorting

- Added Query type extensions for WordPress root fields:
  - wpPage, wpPost, wpBeat, wpMix, wpVideo, wpTutorial
  - allWpCategory, allWpTag, allWpTutorial

### 2. Smart Resolvers

- Added sophisticated resolvers that mimic WordPress behavior:
  - Date fields with formatString support
  - Image fields with proper structure for gatsby-image
  - Featured image support for all content types
  - Category relationships with proper structure
  - ACF fields for beats, mixes, and other custom types

### 3. Proper Mock Data

- Enhanced mock data utility with more realistic fallback content
- Ensured data structures match what WordPress would provide
- Added visual indicators for WordPress bypass mode

## Benefits

This fix ensures:

1. The site builds successfully on Netlify even when WordPress is unavailable
2. All templates and components work with both real WordPress data and bypass mode
3. Consistent appearance and functionality in all environments
4. Developers can work locally without needing WordPress access

## Testing

The fix was verified by:
1. Running local builds with `BYPASS_WORDPRESS=true`
2. Testing all page templates with mock data
3. Validating GraphQL queries

## Next Steps

- Add more specialized resolvers for other field types as needed
- Enhance the mock data library with more diverse content examples
- Implement conditional queries when WordPress is bypassed to improve build time
