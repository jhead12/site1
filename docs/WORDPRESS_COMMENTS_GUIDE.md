# WordPress Comments Integration Guide

## WordPress Comments Sync Options

### Option 1: WordPress REST API Comments (Recommended)
**Pros:** Native WordPress comments, moderation, spam protection
**Cons:** Requires additional API calls

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Fetch comments from WordPress REST API
const fetchComments = async (postId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`${WORDPRESS_URL}/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=${postId}`)
  return response.json()
}
```

### Option 2: GraphQL Comments (Best Integration)
**Pros:** Integrated with gatsby-source-wordpress, cached builds
**Cons:** Requires WP GraphQL Comments plugin

**Setup:**
1. Install WP GraphQL Comments plugin in WordPress
2. Comments will appear in GraphQL schema automatically
3. Include in blog post queries

### Option 3: Headless Comments Service
**Pros:** Modern, fast, no WordPress dependency
**Cons:** Separate system to manage

**Options:**
- Disqus (popular, free tier)
- Commento (privacy-focused)
- Utterances (GitHub-based)
