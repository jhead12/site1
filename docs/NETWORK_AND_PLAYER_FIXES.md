# Network Connectivity & Music Player Removal

## Issues Fixed (June 16, 2025)

### 1. Music Player Removal ✅
**Issue**: Music player displayed at top of screen
**Solution**: Commented out EmbedPage component in header.js

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/header.js`
  - Commented out EmbedPage import
  - Commented out EmbedPage render in header

**Result**: Music player no longer appears in header

### 2. Contentful Network Error ✅
**Issue**: `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND cdn.contentful.com`
**Root Cause**: Network connectivity issues preventing Contentful access

**Solution**: Temporarily disabled Contentful source

**Files Modified:**
- `gatsby-config.js`
  - Commented out gatsby-source-contentful plugin
  - Site now runs on WordPress-only mode

**Result**: Site builds without network errors

## Current Site State
- ✅ WordPress-powered (blog posts, custom post types)
- ✅ No music player in header
- ✅ No network connectivity dependencies
- ✅ Builds and runs successfully

## To Re-enable Contentful Later
When network issues are resolved:
1. Uncomment gatsby-source-contentful in gatsby-config.js
2. Ensure CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID and CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN are set
3. Test connection to cdn.contentful.com

## To Re-enable Music Player
If you want the music player back:
1. Uncomment EmbedPage import in header.js
2. Uncomment <EmbedPage/> in header render

## Alternative Music Player Options
- Move music player to a specific page instead of header
- Make it toggleable/collapsible
- Place it in footer or sidebar
- Create a dedicated music page

## Next Steps
1. Test site functionality without music player
2. Verify WordPress integration works properly
3. Address blog post page generation issues
4. Consider network troubleshooting for Contentful if needed
