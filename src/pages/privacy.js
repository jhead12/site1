  </p>
  <p>
   We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services.

However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other&nbsp;unauthorized&nbsp;third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.

These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section&nbsp;""&nbsp;below.
  </p>
  <p>
   We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the&nbsp;.
  </p>
  <p>
   Withdrawing your consent:&nbsp;If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,&nbsp;which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law,&nbsp;you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section&nbsp;""&nbsp;below&nbsp;or updating your preferences.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor,&nbsp;when applicable law allows,&nbsp;will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
  </p>
  <p>
   Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:&nbsp;You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by&nbsp;clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send,&nbsp;replying&nbsp;"STOP" or "UNSUBSCRIBE"&nbsp;to the SMS messages that we send,&nbsp;or by contacting us using the details provided in the section&nbsp;""&nbsp;below.

  </p>
  <p>
   Account Information
  </p>
  <p>
   If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:

  </p>
  <p>
   11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
  </p>
  <p>
   Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for&nbsp;recognizing&nbsp;and implementing DNT signals has been&nbsp;finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
  </p>
  <p>
   California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for&nbsp;recognizing&nbsp;or&nbsp;honoring&nbsp;DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
